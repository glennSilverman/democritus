Democritus is an example Lift Content Management System.
Now includes role-based authorization.

Note: This application best viewed with Firefox. Some JQuery plugins may not display correctly in 
newer versions of IE.
 
Logged in "admin" users can create content that complies with
Atom Publishing Protocol 1.0, feed the title and description
to the home page, and display the full page when the title link
is clicked.

The system uses wymeditor for content creation and also supports
nested superfish menus which can be linked to content via rewriteRequests.

Content you create can also be published as ATOM feeds.

Set up and useage:

The program is best packaged, compiled and run with Maven 2.

To run, simply create a directory on your local drive, and
edit data_dev in src/main/resources/democritus.properties to use that directory.

eg: data_dev=C:/democritus_data/

This is where your content pages will be stored. Don't forget the "/" at the end.

Then, cd to the directory where you extracted this download and run: 

	mvn jetty:run

to build and launch in the embedded Jetty servlet container. 

Or, if you prefer Tomcat, run:

	mvn package

and then upload target/democritus-<version>.war to your Tomcat webapp directory.

Only users with role of "admin" can edit content and create and edit user roles. At startup, a default
admin user is created for you. Log in as user: admin@test.com, password: "admin" and go to the List Contents
menu to start adding and editing content. Make sure to complete the page and tag entries. Do not include an
extension on your page entry. All pages have an html extension by default.

To view your content on the home page, edit the tags attribute in <lift:ManageContents.feed tags="test"/> in index.html
to include a comma-separated list of tags that you have created for your content. For example,
tags="test,page1,page2", would display the titles and descriptions of pages you have tagged with test, page1 and
page2.
